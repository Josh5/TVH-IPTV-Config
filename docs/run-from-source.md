## Clone project

Clone this project somewhere
```
git clone https://github.com/Josh5/TVH-IPTV-Config.git
cd TVH-IPTV-Config
```

## Run the build scripts

1) Run the setup script. This will create a local environment, installing a Python virtual environment and all dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file, along with the building the frontend. You should re-run this script whenever you pull updates from GitHub.
```
./devops/setup_local_dev_env.sh
```
2) Run the project.
```
source venv-local/bin/activate

# Create a directory for your config files and export it to HOME_DIR
export HOME_DIR="${PWD}/dev_env/config/"
mkdir -p "${HOME_DIR}"

# Migrate database
alembic upgrade head

# Run app
python3 ./run.py
```

> [!NOTE]  
> These above commands will create a directory within this project root called `./dev_env` which contains all configuration and cache data.
> If you want this config path to be somewhere else, set `HOME_DIR` to something else. You will need to ensure you export this before you run `./run.py` each time.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you are running it like this, you will need to configure all TVH stuff yourself.
