Follow these instructions to configure a docker-compose.yml for your system.

Create a directory for your service:
```shell
sudo mkdir -p /data/containers/tvh-iptv
sudo chown -R $(id -u):$(id -g) /data/containers/tvh-iptv
```

If you modify the path `/data/containers/tvh-iptv`, ensure you also modify the path in your docker-compose.yml file below.


Create a Docker Compose file `/data/containers/tvh-iptv/docker-compose.yml`.

Populate this file with the contents of one of these Docker Compose templates:
- [AIO Stack with TIC & TVH in a single container (Recommended)](./compose-files/docker-compose.aio.yml).
- [Side-cart Stack with TIC & TVH in separate containers (Requires that you do some initial setup for TVH)](./compose-files/docker-compose.side-tvh.yml).
- [AIO Stack with multiple HLS Proxy side-carts](./compose-files/docker-compose.aio-with-proxies.yml).

## EXECUTE:

Navigate to your compose location and execute it.
```shell
cd /data/containers/tvh-iptv
sudo docker-compose up -d --force-recreate --pull
```

After container executes successfully, navigate to your docker host URL in your browser on port 9985 and click connect.
`http://<host-ip>:9985/`
